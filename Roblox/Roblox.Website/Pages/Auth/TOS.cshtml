            <p>Last Updated May 25, 2024</p>
            <p>This is essentially just a list of rules for our platform. We reserve the right to update this at any time without any notice, so check here frequently in case the terms are updated. For privacy information, <a href="/auth/privacy">click here</a>.</p>
            <p>A violation of any of these rules could result in a temporary OR permanent ban. New accounts will usually be permanently banned on their first infraction, while older accounts might be given temporary bans (e.g. 1 day or 1 week) depending on the severity.</p>
            <p class="mb-0 fw-bolder">Text Guidelines</p>
            <p>These apply to all text inputs on the site, such as forum posts and in-game chat.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span class="fw-bolder">Do not discriminate or use the N word.</span> The N word is prohibited and will result in a termination no matter the reason or context. Swearing is okay just don't go overkill.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="fw-bolder">Do not reveal personal information pertaining to yourself or others.</span> If a staff asks for an age check, this is different.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="fw-bolder">Try not to start drama or beef.</span> For example, do not create posts "exposing" someone. If you are concerned about a user, you should send a message to a moderator.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="fw-bolder">Do not excessively advertise websites, YouTube channels, Twitter accounts, or other off-platform URLs.</span> You can mention stuff like "Hey, I own example.com", but if you start spamming "join my site" or "subscribe to my YouTube channel", you're going to be banned.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-4 mb-0 fw-bolder">Image Guidelines</p>
            <p>As well as the above text guidelines, these guidelines apply to images uploaded to the site:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span class="fw-bolder">Do not upload content of gore or nsfw content.</span> There are no exceptions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="fw-bolder">Do not upload ANY pornographic content.</span> It will result in an account termination.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-4 mb-0 fw-bolder">Other Notes</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span class="fw-bolder">Owning an alt account will result in a termination.</span> For example, if you own an alt account and we find out, you will get terminated.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="fw-bolder">You are responsible for the security of your account.</span> Password resets are done on a case-by-case basis, depending on if you can verify that you actually owned the account. Pick a strong password - if you forget it or someone guesses it, you may permanently lose access to your account.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="fw-bolder">Do not use the advertising system for advertising URLs that are not relevant to this website.</span> For example, discord servers pertaining to this website (or old Roblox in general) would be ok. A URL pointing to an unknown website (such as "my-revival.com"), your YouTube channel, your Twitch channel, etc, would not be allowed.
