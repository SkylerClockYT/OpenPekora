This is done with the help of Quilkin. Quilkin acts as a proxy between the players and our game servers. When a player connects, Quilkin forwards the request to our VPS, which is then processed by Quilkin. The game server program only receives a local IP address from Quilkin, not the player's direct IP address. This means that even if a severe vulnerability is discovered in our game server software, attackers will not be able to collect the IP addresses of users.
