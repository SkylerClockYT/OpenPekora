@*             <p>Due to the cost associated with creating each place (in server hours, disk space, place conversion, etc), place creation is limited to specific users. The requirements for your account are listed below:</p> *@
@*             <ul> *@
@*                 <li> *@
@*                     Your account must be at least 1 week old, and must have signed up through an application (NOT through an invite). *@
@*                 </li> *@
@*                 <li> *@
@*                     Your account must have some activity: at least a few friends, a customized avatar, time spent playing games, etc. The specific ways we define activity are not going to be listed here, as doing so would make it easy to abuse the place creation system. *@
