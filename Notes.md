# Notes to take care of when using OpenPekora

1- OpenPekora does **NOT** include game-arbiter, you'd have to make one yourself using Node.js otherwise game servers will not work.
2- Appsettings.example.json is also not included but will be soon.
3- This source code is provided As-is, No warranties, nothing just the source and that's it.

**All rights for Pekora/Korone go to supra (coolsupra45)**
