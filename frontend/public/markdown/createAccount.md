Creating an account on Marine is done through an application. This prevents bots and malicious users from joining.

To create an account, you must meet these requirements:
* You must be 13 years or older
* You must have an active account on ROBLOX
* You cannot create more than **one account** on Marine without staff permission.
* You must have a Discord, and be in the Marine Discord, which you can (join here.)[/auth/discord]
* You must have read and agreed to our Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy.

If your application gets denied, you can try again. Remember to fix the thing that got you denied, though.

## Submitting an application

1. Go to our [application page](/auth/application)
2. Fill out the About Me section (Step 1)
   * Your about me **must have at least two sentences** about why you want to join, at least one of the following:
        * Some of your interests (hobbies, passions, etc)
        * What you can create (games, clothing, etc)
    * Of course, don't get too personal.
    * If you don't submit an about me with sufficient information, your application **will be rejected!**
    * Example About Me: "I want to join for nostalgia, I really enjoyed and missed 2017 ROBLOX. I enjoy geopolitics and cars. I can create and port 2017 versions of popular ROBLOX games." *(if you use this, your application is getting rejected!)* (eventually add a table of acceptable and denyable about mes)
3. Enter your ROBLOX username (Step 2)
   * Your account must have some activity on it, you can't put in a brand new account, or an account that has been dead for a long time.
4. Enter your Discord ID (Step 3)
   * To find your Discord ID, you can follow the [steps that Discord has provided in this article.](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID)
   * Remember that **you must be in the [Marine Discord](/auth/discord)** for verification to be successful.
5. Put the Verification Code **in your ROBLOX About Section**
   * Right-click and copy your verification code

   * Go to your ROBLOX page and click button next to "About"
   * ![](/img/instructions/thorium_2kYNl8gyIF.png)
   * Paste in your Verification Code in the About textbox, and press "Save"
   * ![](/img/instructions/thorium_LWdI21eLTc.png)
   * You're done. If your code gets filtered, you can generate a new one under the Verification Code box.
   * You can **only do this for your ROBLOX About section.** Putting it in your Discord bio, Discord status, etc will **not work.**
6. Verify with Cloudflare's captcha and submit the application
7. You will be given an application ID. **This ID is confidential, do not share it!**
   * Sharing your application ID can result in someone making an account under your ROBLOX username, and can result in your account being banned!
   * Store your application ID somewhere safe, where you can access it later. If you lose it, you might lose your account (this only matters until you create an actual account).

Your application is now submitted! You can either wait for a staff member to review your application and approve you, or ping a staff member **once** in the Discord and politely ask them to review your application.
